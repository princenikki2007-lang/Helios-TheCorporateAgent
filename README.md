## 🌟 Core Product Capabilities

- **Command Center Dashboard:** High-density Bloomberg-style overview covering composite compliance health, upcoming statutory deadlines, active document vault counts, open risks, and recent gazette notifications.
- **Company Onboarding:** 3-step setup configuring official corporate identity (CIN, PAN, GSTIN, RoC state jurisdiction, headcount, turnover bracket, and directors), applicable compliance areas, and initial document intake.
- **Document Vault & OCR Extraction:** Drag-and-drop ingestion of PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV, and scanned certificates with automated detection of CIN, PAN, GSTIN, expiration dates, statutory obligations, and risk flags.
- **Document Comparison Engine ("Compare Against Rules"):** Itemized side-by-side comparison of company documents against current statutory regulations with granular Green (Compliant), Yellow (Needs Review), and Red (Potential Non-Compliance) checklists.
- **In-Document AI Chat:** Query specific document clauses and validity dates directly within the document viewer with strict zero-hallucination grounding.
- **Regulatory Intelligence Feed:** Curated official gazette and circular stream from Central Ministries, MCA, CBIC (GST), CBDT, MeitY, and Department of Labour with Level 1-4 source trust ratings.
- **Rule Change Radar ("What's Changed?"):** Side-by-side rule diff engine comparing previous requirements vs new mandates, effective dates, and company-specific impact assessments.
- **Company Impact Engine:** Automated matching of active company parameters (turnover, headcount, state, industry) against newly notified regulations, assigning High, Medium, or Low relevance ratings with 1-click compliance tasks.
- **Parliament & Policy Watch:** Track legislative bills, standing committee reports, and draft consultative rules before they become enforceable law.
- **Policy Impact Analyzer:** Benchmark employee handbooks, POSH rules, overtime policies, and data privacy terms against statutory codes with explainable Policy Health Scores (0-100).
- **Tax & GST Center:** Statutory filing calendar for GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, Form 26Q TDS, and corporate advance tax. Features transparent integration indicators (`Integration not connected — Manual / Verified Filing Records Active`) without fabricating live API syncs.
- **Statutory Approval Center:** Track municipal licenses, Shops & Establishments registrations, trademark applications, and renewal windows.
- **Unified Compliance Calendar:** Consolidated timeline and tabular views with severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- **Explainable Risk Engine:** Multi-vector compliance risk score (0-100) across 8 dimensions (Tax, Corporate, Legal, HR, Documents, Regulatory, Data Privacy, Licenses) with itemized risk drivers.
- **Ask HELIOS AI Legal Assistant:** Conversational AI grounded in company filings and official gazette notifications with clickable citations and statutory disclaimers.
- **Enterprise Governance & Audit Trail:** Write-once, append-only immutable event logs with 1-click CSV export for SOC-2 and statutory auditor verification.
